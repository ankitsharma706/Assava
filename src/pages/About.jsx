            Once upon a time, there were three close friends ‚Äî Arjun, Bala, and
            Cyrus ‚Äî who met every evening at their favorite local caf√©. They
            were inseparable, but there was just one problem: they were all
            broke college students, and could afford only one cup of coffee
            between the three of them. Rather than argue over who would drink
            it, they came up with a tradition: Arjun would take the first sip
            because he had early morning classes and needed the boost. Bala,
            always the chatterbox, would hold the cup and tell stories while
            taking small sips in between. Cyrus, the most philosophical, would
            finish the last drop, claiming the coffee tasted best when it had
            ‚Äúsoaked in the wisdom of friendship.‚Äù
